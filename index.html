      <h2>Research Interests</h2>
      <p>
        My work investigates the neural mechanisms that allow fleeting sensory inputs to be
        transformed into stable conscious experience. I use large-scale multi‑electrode
        recordings in non‑human primates to decode how ensembles of neurons in the
        ventrolateral prefrontal cortex encode visual stimuli, maintain short‑term
        memory traces, and build predictive internal models of the world. I am broadly
        interested in how these processes support perception, memory and decision making.

          <p>
            We recorded neuronal populations in ventrolateral prefrontal cortex while macaques
            passively viewed visual sequences. The same neurons encoded both the specific
            images being shown and the abstract structure of the sequence; these representations
            updated rapidly when a mismatch occurred and generalized across different sequences.

            We demonstrated that ventrolateral prefrontal cortex population activity
            reliably encodes the identity of visual stimuli within ~60 ms, even under
            conditions that reduce post‑perceptual processing. Decoding accuracy
            drops as new stimuli appear, raising questions about whether this activity
            reflects conscious access, phenomenal content or preconscious waves.

          <p>
            Contrary to the assumption that short‑term memory faithfully preserves
            high‑acuity foveal input, we discovered that remembered foveal targets
            are systematically mislocalized. The largest errors occurred for the
            most central targets, illustrating that the neural representation of
            sensory memory can be surprisingly distorted.

          <p>
            We developed a deep learning algorithm to detect complex spikes in cerebellar Purkinje cells, which are
            critical for motor learning but difficult to identify due to their complex waveforms. Our method matches
            human expert performance in accuracy and duration estimation while being significantly faster.

            We introduced U'n'Eye, a convolutional neural network for saccade detection that achieves human-level
            accuracy even for challenging eye movements like microsaccades. This open-source tool outperforms existing
            methods and facilitates robust analysis of eye movement data.

          <p>
            We demonstrated that microsaccades, often thought to be involuntary, can be generated on demand to
            remembered locations. These memory-guided microsaccades are precise, associated with distinct neural
            activity in the superior colliculus, and reveal a link between oculomotor control and working memory.

          <p>
            We found that microsaccades trigger long-lasting, rhythmic oscillations in visual detection performance in
            the alpha and beta frequency bands. These oscillations are sequentially pulsed across visual hemifields,
            suggesting that microsaccades temporally organize visual processing in a direction-dependent manner.

          <p>
            We investigated the role of serotonin receptors in a rat model of absence epilepsy. We found that activating
            5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors suppresses absence seizures, suggesting that these receptors exert a negative
            control over seizure generation and could be targets for new anti-epileptic drugs.

      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        I am a neuroscientist fascinated by how the brain builds internal representations of the world. I received my
        Ph.D. in
        systems neuroscience at the Werner Reichardt Centre for Integrative Neuroscience, University of Tübingen, where
        I worked
        with Ziad M. Hafed on microsaccades, neural oscillations and machine‑learning methods for detecting rare events.
        Following my doctorate I joined the Cognitive Neuroimaging Unit at NeuroSpin (CEA/Paris‑Saclay) to collaborate
        with
        Timo van Kerkoerle, Bechir Jarraya, Theofanis Panagiotaropoulos, and Stanislas Dehaene on prefrontal neural
        codes and internal models. Since November 2022
        I have been a post‑doctoral researcher in Markus Siegel’s laboratory at the Magnetoencephalography (MEG) Centre
        of the
        University of Tübingen. My long‑term research aims to understand how transient sensory inputs and memory traces
        interact
        to generate stable conscious experience and behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of the lab, I enjoy exploring cultural life, engaging in science outreach and mentoring younger
        scientists.
